📝 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 & 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐏𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐬:
Based on the laboratory report, here is a detailed analysis of the rebar consumption data from 2018 to 2025 and additionally a summary report yearly breakdown of Cement, Stone, Sand, Admixture.

𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 (𝐑𝐞𝐛𝐚𝐫):
**Total Quantity:** The total quantity of rebar is **5,292.92 **𝐭𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 **194** 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬.
**Peak Year:** The year **2019** 𝐬𝐚𝐰 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐡𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐨𝐟 𝐢𝐧𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝 𝐫𝐞𝐛𝐚𝐫 𝐚𝐭 **2,538.85** 𝐭𝐨𝐧𝐬 and the highest number of consignments with 82. This represents 47.97% of the total inbound quantity.
**Dominant Grade:** The most common grade of rebar is 500𝐖, which accounts for **99%** 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐭𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐛𝐚𝐫 𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐲 (**5,242.92** 𝐭𝐨𝐧𝐬). The remaining 1% is grade 420W.
**Most Common Diameter:** The Ø 20 𝐦𝐦 𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐫𝐞𝐛𝐚𝐫 𝐢𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐦𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐭, making up **19.35%** of the total quantity (**1,023.96 **𝐭𝐨𝐧𝐬). This is followed by Ø 28 mm at 17.79% (941.47 tons) and Ø 12 mm at 16.11% (852.95 tons).
**Significant Drop:** There was a significant drop in rebar quantity after 2019, with a sharp decline in 2023 to just 21.5 tons from two consignments.

I analyzed the reports on rebar and corresponding construction material quantity and found some interesting insights that highlight shifts in the industry from 2018 to 2025. This data underscores the importance of a detailed analysis in understanding material trends and supply chain dynamics.
